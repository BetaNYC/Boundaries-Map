## Architecture
The NYC Boundaries Map is a landing page that displays a Carto basemap and outlines for each row of eleven shapefiles stored in BetaNYC's Carto account: 1) NYC Community Districts, 2) NYC Police Precincts, 3) NYC Sanitation Districts, 4) NYC Fire Battilions, 5) NYC School Districts, 6) NYC Health Center Disticts, 7) NYC Council Districts, 8) Congressional Districts, 9) State Assembly Districts, 10) State Senate Districts, and 11) Neighborhood Tabulation Areas. Clicking on a community district further queries each of the remaining the datasets to determine which geometries overlap with the community district. Searching for a NYC location queries the City's Geoclient API for the geo-coordinates that correspond to the entered address, repositions the map to this location, and then queries each of the eleven datasets to determine which geometries the geo-coordinates are located within. Datasets in Carto need to be updated as the geographic parameters change.

### Carto.js v4
We use Carto.js to create and style map layers from data stored in the BetaNYC Carto account.
* [Source](https://libs.cartocdn.com/carto.js/v4.1.2/carto.min.js)
* [Documentation](https://carto.com/developers/carto-js/reference/)

### Leaflet.js 
We use leaflet.js for additional JS-based mapping features such as re-centering the map to certain geographic coordinates on a location search.
* [Source](https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.3.1/dist/leaflet.js)
* [Documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.2.html)


### NYC Geoclient API
When users enter a text address into the location search field, the system queries the Geoclient API for the lat/lon of that location. The map re-centers to this lat/lon.  
* [Source](https://developer.cityofnewyork.us/api/geoclient-api)
* [Documentation](https://api.cityofnewyork.us/geoclient/v1/doc)

### Fetch API
We use the Fetch API for browser-based Web requests to the Carto SQL API and the NYC Geoclient API.
* [Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
